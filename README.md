# Music Recommender System

The data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VYGXrlTADkN665ahv7ZXI7pH0N_u2bWD
Adjusting the data path in the code is necessary. We used the folder "data_task2" to save our files.
To be able to run the notebook, jupyter notebook is required and installing the packes as defined in the first code block.
We used Python 3.9 to calculate the results.

# Imports
We are using some basic machine learning libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

# Data analysis

A small analysis part to get the genre distribution of the dataset.

# Performance Metrics

We are using the following metrics to evaluate our model:
- Precision
- MRR
- NDCG

# Evaluation Framework

The framework is designed to easy evaluate different models. Understanding this part is not crucial to evaluate new models.

# Evaluation

Data is loaded and evaulated. Additionally, a REcall Precision plot is displayed.
